# Lighting-System
A designer-friendly lighting system, which can be adjusted through a dropdown box accessed through the details panel. the spotlight has a total of 4 modes: static, pulsing, following the player (while remaining in its location), and moving with the player. Within the plugin, there is also a trigger box that allows the light to switch modes in play whenever the player walks through it. 

There is a spotlight provided that has the options already built into it and you can place this spotlight multiple times and change the mode for it, if you place a seperate, normal spotlight, the plugin will not work.

In order to use the trigger to switch modes, place it into the world and select the light you wish to change modes with the dropper tool from the details section, and in the blueprint there will be the option to set the mode to whichever you want it to switch to.
